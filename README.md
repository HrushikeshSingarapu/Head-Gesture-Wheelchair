## 🚩 Problem Statement
Individuals with severe physical disabilities often cannot operate traditional wheelchairs. This project provides an affordable and intuitive **gesture-based mobility solution** that allows users to control movement through simple head motions.

---

## 🧠 System Overview

Head movements are detected using a motion sensor. The microcontroller interprets tilt directions and controls motors accordingly.

### Functional Blocks
- Head Motion Detection  
- Signal Processing  
- Direction Control Logic  
- Motor Driver Interface  
- Battery-Powered Mobility

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. Motion sensor detects head tilt  
2. Microcontroller processes X/Y axis values  
3. Gesture is mapped to movement (Forward / Left / Right / Stop)  
4. Motor driver activates wheels accordingly  
5. System runs on battery for portable operation
